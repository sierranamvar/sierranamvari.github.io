Final Project

Summary:
I got the idea for my final while I was in class and it had first been mentioned to us. I think I had asked something about recreating a game, and so I just stuck to it ever since. My inspiration is based off of the game "Papa's Cupcakeria" which is part of a series of different games within a food industry. I renamed my game "CC's Cupcakeria" because my nickname is CC. For this game I also decided I would change up a lot of the techniques and designs used to assemble the cupcakes and what the customers/avatars look like.

Features:

1) I have buttons that will take you to a new html page, for example the very first button on the opening screen says "Play" and once you do it takes you into the first scene showing your avatar, this will continue when you press "Next Page" to then meet your first customer and so on. 

2) I added a "Take Order" button that appears on the third html page next to the customer, and once it is pressed, I made it so that the button itself disappears and in place over to the side, an order note appears simultaneously with the graphics showing the cupcake liner, filling, frosting, and topping.

3) I used the animate function to move the decoration items towards the cupcake when clicked on, which makes the frosting move above the cupcake and then disappears as the cupcake changes to have frosting applied to it. Same thing with the cherry, but instead of disappearing it just stays there.

4) I added a "Restart" button at the end using the animate hover function when the cursor reaches the order complete message at the top. I also made sure that by having it only appear when hovering over the complete message, that you won't be able to see the button before the complete message even when hovering over that section.

Design Elements:
I put a lot of hardwork into making every single one of the graphic designs that are shown within the game, from the two different pixel avatars, to each store background, every single cupcake design element, the baking tray, the fill tube, cupcake liner, frosting and frosting bag, cherry, and the counter tables as well. I really wanted to make it look the best I could with my own general knowledge in graphic design, and I feel as though I managed to keep elements of the original game, but 100% added my own touches and designs to it. I think my favorite design element was actually creating the order ticket that apperas after the take order button, it was such a cute touch to show each of my main cupcake graphics seperated similarly to the original game style, and to have made them simplified versions of what the actual graphic will look like on the next pages. I also loved designing the avatars and of course the little worker uniform and hat on the avatar that has my features.
